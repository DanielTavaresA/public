# DevOps

These exercises will help you get started with git and use it in a way that will maximize collaboration and minimize conflicts between developers. 
This exercise set assumes you are familiar with `git init, add, commit, push, status` commands, and familiar with the command line and running `git` from the command line.
You will also learn about GitHub and its pull request and code review features.
Finally, this exercise set introduces continuous integration, to which you then add code coverage and static analysis.

## Exercises

  - The [first exercise](commit-messages.md) will teach you about commits in general and how to write effective commit messages.
  - The [second exercise](git-workflow) shows you how to effectively use the branching and merging model for collaborative software development.
  - The [third exercise](operations.md) shows how to set up a simple CI pipeline directly in GitHub.

## Solutions

You can find the solutions [here](solutions), but please try to solve the exercises by yourself before peeking at the solutions.
