# User stories - university application

Imagine you work for a company that wanted to develop an application for universities management. You received a description of what the program should do and your task is to write more specific user stories about this.

Here is the description:

> The program will be the administrative backbone of the university. Almost all collaborators will use it. The HR (Human resources) will record each collaborator on it, they will pay the salaries through it as well. Academic services will register students with all their personal information and then use the system to be sure that every student follows the rules for their cursus (duration of the studies, number of credits, payment of the bill). Professors will enter the grades and use this tool to send messages to the students registered in their lessons (like an announcements channel, not a forum nor a chat). Students will be able to browse available courses, register for the one they want, track their results (grades and credits they got), pay the bill, and update their personal information. Collaborators can access the program to change their personal information (address, bank account for the salary). Each type of user must be able to access the functions she needs but not more. 

Your task is to extract from this description as many user stories as you can. The stories should have the following form:

> As a [user type], I want to [action] so that [goal/expected outcome].

> As a HR, I want to be able to record a collaborator to it so that he will be part of the database

> As a HR, I want to be able to pay their salary trought it so that they will recieve their money

> As a academic service, I want to be able to add students to the database, so that he appears in the students database

> As a academic service, I want to be able to register students with their informations so that we have their coordinates

> As a academic sevice, I want to be able to remove students to the database so that the don't appear anymore on it

> As a academic service I want to be able to verify if a student follow the rules of their cursus, so that I can inform him on his situation

> As a academic service I want to be able to see if they paid the semester so that I can remind them to do it 

> As a professor I want to be able to enter the grades so that I can register the results of the tests

> As a professor I want to have access to the students registered to my course so that I can monitor the audience

> As a professor I want to be able to send messages so that I can inform them about the course

> As a student I want to be able to browse through courses so that I can study
