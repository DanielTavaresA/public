# Software Engineering - Final Exam

This exam comes from the `student-GASPAR` repo in the `sweng-epfl` GitHub organization. Push your answers to the `master` branch in this repo.

Grading will be done on a snapshot of the `master` branch of this repository from GitHub, not your machine. The snapshot will be taken at **19:15 on Monday, 18-Jan-2021**, and access to this repo will be terminated at that point. Please be careful not to overwrite your work, as we will not roll back your commits. Commit and push your work often, to make sure you don't lose local changes and to mitigate the risk of GitHub going down shortly before the deadline. We use automated scripts to extract the answers from your repo, so follow the instructions exactly, and do not place stray characters in the files you push, or else you will likely lose many points.

We strongly advise that you read each problem statement at least twice. You need to provide a correct answer to the _correct_ question in order to receive full credit. A correct answer to a _wrong or misinterpreted_ question will not earn credit. If you have any doubts, ask the SwEng staff.

Exam rules:

- The exam is open-book, so you can consult any resource during the exam (website, class material, StackOverflow, etc.), but you are not permitted to copy code from any such resource, and the resource must have been created prior to the start of the exam.
- You may use code that you yourself wrote for this class prior to the exam, or code given in the lectures.
- You are not permitted to interact with or receive/give any assistance from/to any human during the exam, except for the course staff. Any use of Slack, Discord, Facebook, e-mail, Hangouts, IRC, phone, SMS, Skype, TeamViewer, WhatsApp, Telegram, or similar will be automatically deemed to constitute cheating.
- Use your personal laptop for the exam. If you do not have a laptop, notify the SwEng staff at least one week prior to the exam, and we will provide a laptop to you on the day of the exam.
- You must do all your work locally on your laptop; doing it on a remote computer or VM constitutes cheating.
- Please cite in your solution all resources you use (e.g., by giving the URL) that are not SwEng course materials or were not prepared by you in the context of this course. Using such resources without citing them in the exam constitutes plagiarism.
- If you wish to leave early, you must show your CAMIPRO card to one of the course staff and await their confirmation that you can indeed depart; we will turn off access to your exam repo at that time.
- If you need to use the bathroom during the exam, you must be escorted by a member of the staff. Leaving the exam room without an escort will be treated as an early departure: your repo will be locked, and you will not be permitted to re-enter.
- If you leave early without showing your CAMIPRO card to one of the staff, you will not receive any points for the exam.
- Toward the end of the exam, the staff may ask you to remain seated, in order to avoid disturbing students who want to work until the end of the exam timeslot.
- You are not permitted to wear headphones during the exam, except for medical reasons approved by Prof. Candea.

Any violations of the exam rules will be handled as per [EPFL's cheating and plagiarism rules](https://www.epfl.ch/about/overview/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2.4.0.2Disciplinary_Rules_Regulations_ang.pdf). We will employ multiple plagiarism detection tools, in accordance with EPFL policies.
